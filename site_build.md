# Building your site
To build your site open your site folder in your terminal and run
```
flame build
```
This will put all of the compiled site data in the ```site_data``` folder. You can fire up a web server in this folder to see
your site! I recommend [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)
